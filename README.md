# hello-world
Working on an app for an MBA project that will have a login, will send the user a document that he or she can read, and then can sign (or reasonable facsimile of those elements) 


If anybody can point me to code snippets that could help me show a document, log in to a page (doesn't really have to go anywhere at this point, just return true for a proof of concept, and allow someone to check a box that says "yes, I sign" or something
